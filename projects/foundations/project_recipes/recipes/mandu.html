    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Mandu are Korean dumplings typically filled with a flavorful mixture of meat and vegetables. They can be steamed,
      boiled, pan-fried, or deep-fried, and are often served with a soy-vinegar dipping sauce. Mandu are enjoyed year-round,
      but are especially popular during holidays like Lunar New Year.</p>
    
    <p>Fillings can vary widely, from ground pork or beef to tofu and kimchi, making them versatile and suitable for
      different diets. Mandu can be served as a main dish, side dish, or in soups such as mandu-guk, a comforting dumpling
      soup.</p>
