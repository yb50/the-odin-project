    // Callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. Callbacks are functions that are executed asynchronously, or at a later time. 

    myDiv.addEventListener("click", function() {
      // Do something!
    });

    // Unfortunately, though they are useful in situations like the above example, using callbacks can get out of hand, especially when you need to chain several of them together in a specific order.
